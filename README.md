Welcome to JSFunHouse!

Helo! Did you hear about the JavaScript developer who walked into a bar? They didn't get the server's response, so they kept refreshing.

This repository is just my note on JavaScript, but I hope it brings joy and enlightenment to many people.

It will keep evolving as my understanding of JavaScript progresses.

If you have any suggestions, please hit me up at ifaqriansyah@gmail.com.

Cheers! ðŸŽ‰
